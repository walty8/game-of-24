## How to play?

1. open the website
2. use the rules of [game of 24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_%28puzzle%29) to solve the question
3. if you failed to figure out the solution, click 'show answer'
4. click 'next question' to get to the next one


## Features
1. every question can be solved
2. all possible solutions will be shown
3. the site can work offline after opened once (with service worker)
4. responsive layout, work on mobile phone

## Why build this
Just want to play the game with my kid any time. It's especially useful to kill the time on a flight :) 

There is no button to click when one player figures out the solution, because he/she only needs to shout it out (or say it lightly).
